                    <p>My internship placement was held with Unitic Ltd (2022), which is a start-up company
                        trying to create a solution to tailgating by allowing drivers to communicate with each
                        other through rear LED displays. The company started in 2021 and was still in the middle 
                        of finalising their product before it is launched into production.

                    <P>The Roadsage app allows for the user to customise the specific communications on the LED display. This can be customised through the app for both the remote product and app display. The app needs to be intuitive and easy to use safely while driving. </P>

                            <p>The user research days involved a lot of planning beforehand to make sure the days stayed on schedule. I created some marketing pages to be utilised during the research. Consent forms were distributed before the user testing took place to follow sound ethical practice. I chose card sorting and interviews as they are both beneficial UX research methods that can give plentiful qualitative data.</p>
                    
                            <p><b>INTERVIEWS</b></p>
                            <p> Interviews were chosen instead of focus groups as you can probe deeper into the thoughts of the user and I felt comfortable in my interviewing skills after carrying out several interviews during other projects.</p>
                            <p><b>CARD SORTING</b></p>
                            <p> As for card sorting, I chose to use open over closed as closed card sorting can feel more like a test with right and wrong answers, whereas open card sorting tells you more about the userâ€™s way of thinking. Furthermore, I chose to use moderated over unmoderated as I wanted more interaction with the user and understanding their thought process. Lastly, I chose the traditional method of paper card sorting over digital, as it is easier for the user to go through more cards faster.</p>

                            <P>I found this internship experience invaluable and there were many learning opportunities
                                and challenges to overcome. I was able to utilise my user research skills gained
                                from university and put them into practice such as interviews and card sorting. There were 
                                communication challenges that came from working at home, but I kept focused and had weekly 
                                meeting to discuss ideas and the progress of the project. To conclude I think that this internship 
                                has given me good practice to put my skills into a
                                professional setting and deal with the trials of the workplace. I was
                                successful in completing all the goals outlined and received
                                good feedback on the client from the work produced.
