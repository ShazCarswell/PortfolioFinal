                            <p>Research was conducted with international students already studying at Edinburgh Napier University. Our questioning was centred around the transitional period upon starting at Napier and their studies.</p>

                            <p>Napier University provides a different form of education which is more critical thinking based</p>
                            <p>Studying in Scotland provides opportunities for future employment </p>

                            <p> <b>SECONDARY RESEARCH:</b> </p>
                            <P>It was found that all the POSITIVES of studying abroad can be NEGATIVES if the transition of the student is not handled with care and recognising "Help seeking behaviour".</P>
                            <p>It's all about the university community coming together as a whole, and the quality of relationships make the biggest difference.</p>

                            <P>As a team we decided to further investigate aspects of adjusting to Scottish culture and helping international students connect with each other. Accommodation was a big issue all round but as a team we felt that it was too big a challenge to tackle within the constraints of the project boundaries.</P>
